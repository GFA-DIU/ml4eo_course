The increasing availability and accessibility of earth observation imagery provides significant opportunities to assess status and monitor changes in land cover, yet unlocking such capability is contingent on availability of relevant ground truth data to calibrate and validate classification algorithms. The critically needed spatially-explicit ground-truth data are often unavailable in sub-Saharan African farming systems and this constrains development of relevant analytical tools to monitor cropland dynamics or generate [near]real-time insights on farming systems.  \n","\n","This land cover classification was implemented based on available data which was collected under a multi-year project (https://tamasa.cimmyt.org/) which was focused on advancing digital agronomic innovation for decision support in maize-based farming systems. Therefore, the ground truth data in this analytical workflow is rich in maize farm locations, and contains much fewer data points for other crop types within the focal geography. Considering this limitation, the scope of this classification tool and this tutorial is limited to binary classification of maizelands (i.e. maize vs. non-maize cultivated) within the period of data collection (i.e. 2017)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2CTyM9Ldlv8f"},"source":["## Importing and visualizing data\n","Import the Nigerian boundary as the focal geography and maize target region boundary as the area of interest (AOI). Using the code below, you will import a FeatureCollection object, and filter by \"Country\" to select \"Nigeria\". FeatureCollections are groups of features (spatial data and attributes). Filter is the method to extract a specific set of features from a feature collection. Assign the output to a variable called nigeriaBorder. The analyses will be limited to the maize target region in Nigeria, i.e. the region that accounts for ~70% of Nigeria's maize production. Therefore, you will import a predefined shapefile layer (already converted to GEE asset) and assign it as the variable aoi. Display both layers to the map using Map.addLayer() with customized display parameters."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":24385,"status":"ok","timestamp":1683730795088,"user":{"displayName":"Philippe
