    "# EXERCISE 5.1: Land-Use-Land-Cover Pipeline using Sentinel Hub \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of Sentinal Hub via API (sentinelhub-py) with Rwandan geodata to:**\n",
    "* a) Extract an AOI from a larger dataset\n",
    "* b) Apply cloud masking \n",
    "* c) Apply imputation (e.g. temporal interpolation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook consists of preliminary steps for data accessing and exploration towards constructing a machine learning pipeline for predicting the land use and land cover for the region of interest. We will use satellite images obtained by ESA's Sentinel-2 through the whole process of creating the pipeline, with details provided at each step. The actual model training will take place in the next module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you start\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the example you'll need a Sentinel Hub account. If you do not have one yet, you can create a free trial account at [Sentinel Hub webpage](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/trial). If you are a researcher you can even apply for a free non-commercial account at [ESA OSEO page](https://earth.esa.int/aos/OSEO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the account set up, please configure the `sentinelhub` package's configuration file following the [configuration instructions](http://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html). For Processing API request you need to obtain and set your `oauth` client id and secret. Also you can find this [guide ](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/user-guides/beginners-guide/)useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the Area-of-Interest (AOI):\n",
    "   * Obtain the outline of AOI\n",
    "   * Split into manageable smaller tiles\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the integrated [sentinelhub-py](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py) package in order to fill the EOPatches with some content (band data, cloud masks, ...)\n",
    "   * Define the time interval\n"
